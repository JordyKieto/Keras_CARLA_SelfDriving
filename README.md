# Keras CARLA SelfDriving

This project showcases the development of a neural network using Keras to enable autonomous driving within the CARLA simulator. CARLA, an open-source urban driving simulator, provides a realistic and safe environment for testing and training self-driving algorithms. Industry leaders like Waymo leverage CARLA to simulate diverse driving scenarios and refine their autonomous vehicle models.

In this project, I tackled the complex problem space of autonomous driving by building a Keras neural network capable of processing sensory inputs (like camera images) and making real-time driving decisions (steering, acceleration, braking). To facilitate experimentation and collaboration, I also developed an API that seamlessly integrates custom models into the CARLA environment, making it easier for researchers and enthusiasts to test their own solutions.
