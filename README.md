# Keras CARLA SelfDriving

This project showcases the development of a neural network using Keras to enable autonomous driving within the CARLA simulator. CARLA, an open-source urban driving simulator, provides a realistic and safe environment for testing and training self-driving algorithms. Industry leaders like Waymo leverage CARLA to simulate diverse driving scenarios and refine their autonomous vehicle models.

In this project, I tackled the complex problem space of autonomous driving by building a Keras neural network capable of processing sensory inputs (like camera images) and making real-time driving decisions (steering, acceleration, braking). To facilitate experimentation and collaboration, I also developed an API that seamlessly integrates custom models into the CARLA environment, making it easier for researchers and enthusiasts to test their own solutions.

## Data Science Skills Demonstrated:

* Neural Network Development: Designed and implemented a neural network architecture suitable for the autonomous driving task.
* Model Training and Optimization: Leveraged training data from the CARLA simulator to optimize the model's performance.
* Sensor Data Processing: Processed and transformed raw sensory data (images, lidar, etc.) into a format suitable for the neural network.
* Real-Time Decision Making: Implemented algorithms for real-time control of the vehicle based on the model's predictions.
* API Development: Designed and built a user-friendly API for seamless integration of custom models into CARLA.
* Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking: Navigated the challenges of autonomous driving and developed innovative solutions.
